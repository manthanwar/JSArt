          <p>
            IN NO EVENT, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL LICENSOR OR ITS LICENSORS,
            PARTNERS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
            FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, COSTS, LOSSES
            OR EXPENSE, (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOST PROFITS, LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF USE,
            LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, DAMAGE TO NETWORKS, EQUIPMENT, OR
            HARDWARE, OR THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR TECHNOLOGY). Regardless of

              Information&rdquo;) developed or acquired by Licensor including, but not limited to,
              technical and non-technical data, formulas, patterns, compilations, devices, methods,
              techniques, drawings and processes related to the Software, which constitutes the
              valuable intellectual property of Licensor and its suppliers.]

            <li>
              <strong>Use of Confidential Information.</strong> Each party will comply with all laws
              and regulations that apply to use, transmission, storage, disclosure, or destruction
              of Confidential Information. Both Parties agree to hold the other party&rsquo;s
              Confidential Information in the strictest confidence. Confidential Information shall
              not be disclosed by either party to anyone except an employee, or agent who has a need
              to know same, or who is bound by a non-disclosure and confidentiality provision at
              least as restrictive as those set forth in this Agreement. Each party agrees to ensure
              that its employees, agents, representatives, and contractors are advised of the
              confidential nature of the Confidential Information and are precluded from taking any
              action prohibited under this Agreement. Licensor may use any technical information
              that Customer provides to Licensor for any of Licensor&rsquo;s reasonable business
              purposes, including product support and development.
              <em>
                Customer acknowledges that the Software may include a monitoring capability that
                sends anonymous statistics about performance, device utilization and network size
                remotely to Licensor.
              </em>

            <li>
              <strong>Ownership of Information.</strong> Except as explicitly stated in this
              Agreement, the party receiving the Confidential Information is granted no license or
              conveyance of disclosing party&rsquo;s Confidential Information or any intellectual
              property rights therein. Title to the disclosing party&rsquo;s Confidential

              <strong>Remedies</strong>. It is further understood and agreed that money damages may
              not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of the confidentiality provisions of this
              Agreement and that either party may be entitled to equitable relief, including
              injunction and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach. Such remedies
              may not be deemed exclusive remedies for a breach of these provisions but may be
              deemed in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.

              similar information, customer surveys or other requests for feedback
              (&ldquo;Communications&rdquo;). Licensor will send Communications via in-product
              notices or email to registered email addresses of named contacts, or will post
              Communications on Licensor&rsquo;s website. Customer may notify Licensor of
              Customer&rsquo;s preference not to receive any such Communications (which may have a
              technical impact on Customer&rsquo;s use of the Software and the provision of any
              Support Services). Licensor reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, to
              revise, supplement, and otherwise modify this Agreement and to impose new or
              additional rules, policies, terms or conditions (collectively, &ldquo;Additional
              Terms&rdquo;) on Customer&rsquo;s use of the Software. Such Additional Terms will be
              effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement upon posting the revised
              agreement on Licensor&rsquo;s website and Customer waives any right to receive a
              specific notice of each such revision. Customer&rsquo;s use of the Software signifies

          <p>
            [Licensor shall indemnify and hold harmless Customer and its officers, employees, agents
            and representatives and defend any action brought against same with respect to any
            third-party claim, demand or cause of action, including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s
            fees, to the extent that it is based upon a claim that the Software infringes or
            violates any United States patents, copyrights, trade secrets, or other proprietary
            rights of a third-party. Customer may, at its own expense, assist in such defense if it
            so desires, provided that Licensor shall control such defense and all negotiations
            relating to the settlement of any such claim. Customer shall promptly provide Licensor
            with written notice of any claim which Customer believes falls within the scope of this
            indemnification provision of the Agreement. In the event that the Software or any
            portion thereof is held to constitute an infringement and its use is enjoined, Licensor
            may, at its sole option and expense, (i) modify the infringing Software so that it is
            non-infringing, (ii) procure for Customer the right to continue to use the infringing
            Software, or (iii) replace said Software with suitable, non-infringing software.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensor will have no obligation for any claims to the
            extent such claims result from (i) modifications or alterations of the Software made by
            or for Customer or any other party that were not provided by Licensor or authorized by
            Licensor in writing; (ii) use outside the scope of the license granted hereunder, (iii)
            use of a superseded or previous version of the Software if infringement would have been
            avoided by the use of a newer version which Licensor made available to Customer, or (iv)
            use of the Software in combination with any other software, hardware or products not
            supplied by Licensor. This indemnity obligation is subject to the limitation of
            liability and does not apply to any open source components of the Software.]

              Maintenance Patches and Upgrades/Updates available if and when made generally
              available by Licensor. If a question arises as to whether a product offering is an
              Upgrade/Update or a new product or separate component, Licensor&rsquo;s determination
              will prevail, provided that Licensor treats the product offering as a new product or
